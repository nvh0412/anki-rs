# Ngurra

Ngurra (`Ngurra` signifies `Home` in the Aboriginal language of Australia, which holds significant meaning for me as my second home country.) is a Rust project that aims to clone the popular flashcard application Anki. It is a hobby project created to practice Rust programming language and explore the development of flashcard applications.
